# com.kandy.phonegap
[**Kandy**](http://www.kandy.io/) is a full-service cloud platform that enables real-time communications for business applications. **KandyPhonegap** is a [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) plugin that makes it easy to use Kandy API with Cordova/PhoneGap.

**Kandy** homepage: [kandy.io](http://www.kandy.io/)
## Supported Platforms
- Android
- IOS (coming soon)

## Installation
Check out PhoneGap CLI [docs](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface)
before starting out.

    cordova plugin add "path/to/plugin/directory" --variable API_KEY=<api-key> --variable API_SECRET=<api-secret>
or

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/kodeplusdev/kandyphonegap.git --variable API_KEY=<api-key> --variable API_SECRET=<api-secret>
## Getting Started
This plugin defines a global `Kandy` object, which provide an easy way to interact with KANDY.
Although the object is in the global scope, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.
    
```js
    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log(Kandy);
    }
```
After the `deviceready` event, you can config and register listeners to receive events from KANDY background service
```js
    function onDeviceReady(){
        ...
        Kandy.initialize({
            widgets: {
                chat: "kandy-chat-widget", // id chat element
                call: "kandy-call-widget", // id call element
                // ...
            },
            listeners: {
                onChatReceived: function(message){
                    // your code here
                }
                // ...
            }
        });
    }
```
After you initialize the `KandyPlugin`, you can use `Kandy` with following syntax:
```js
    Kandy.access.login(function(s){ // successCallback function
        // your code here
    }, function(e){ // errorCallback function
        // your code here
    }, username, password);
```
or as a widget:
```html
    <div id="kandy-call-widget" action-call-error="onCallError"></div>
```
See [API Reference](#api-reference) for more details.
## How to use example codes
**Create the App**

Go to the directory where you maintain your source code, and run a command such as the following:
```shell
    phonegap create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
```
Then, copy example source codes from [`demo`](/demo) directory of this plugin to your app directory

**Add plugin**

Go to your app directory and run a command such as the following:
```shell
    phonegap local plugin add directory/to/this/plugin --variable API_KEY=<your_api_key> --variable API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>
```
**Build the App**

Run a command such as the following:
```shell
    phonegap build android
```
## Widgets
The plugin provides several widgets that you can easily use Kandy. You can config id of widgets in the `initialize` function.
### Provisioning widget
Default id of the provisioning widget is `kandy-provisioning-widget`. Some callback actions you can use: `request`, `validate`, `deactivate`

Example:
```html
    <div id="kandy-provisioning-widget" action-request-success="onRequestSuccess" action-request-error="onRequestError"></div>
```
### Access widget
